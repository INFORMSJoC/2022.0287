## Results
`results\Table2`: reports the overall estimation results for pure homophily case. Detailed estimation results for each model across 100 simulated datasets can be found in separate worksheets within this Excel file. Additionally, beta distribution (refer to Figure 2(a) in the paper) is provided in a worksheet in the same file.

`results\Table3`: reports the overall estimation results for positive peer effect case. Detailed estimation results for each model on each simulated dataset are available in separate worksheets in this Excel file. Additionally, beta distribution (refer to Figure 2(b) in the paper) is saved in a worksheet in the same file.

`results\TableA2`: reports the pairwise relationship between latent homophily features and individual embedding dimension. 

`results\TableA3`: reports the regression of latent homophily features on entire embedding vector. 

`results\FigureA2(a,b,c,d)`: illustrates four relationship patterns between latent homophily features and individual embedding dimension. 

`results\FigureA3`: reports the robustness check results for pure homophily case in Appendix H.

`results\FigureA4`: reports the robustness check results for positive peer efffect case in Appendix H.
